# Weather-Prediction
Initial Commit
To train a data model for weather prediction using Meteostat data for Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta (Meteostat ID 72219) for the year 2020, the following steps are below:

1. Collect the necessary data from Meteostat by specifying the location (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta) and time period (2020).
2. Preprocess the data by cleaning it and ensuring that it is in a suitable format for modeling. This involve handling missing values, converting data types, and scaling the data.
3. Split the data into training and test sets. The training set will be used to fit the model, while the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.
4. Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm or model for weather prediction. There are many options to choose from, such as linear regression, random forest, or a neural network. Here, linear regression, random forest and ML Regresso.
5. Train the model on the training set by fitting it to the data.
6. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set by comparing the predicted weather conditions to the actual weather conditions.

Future Work: 
1. Fine-tune the model by repeating steps 5 and 6, using different algorithms or model configurations, until you achieve satisfactory performance.
